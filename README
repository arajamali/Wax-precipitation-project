This repository serves as an introduction to the problem of wax formation 
and its thermodynamic modeling. Wax deposition in surface equipment and 
production pipelines gives rise to a wide variety of problems encountered 
in the petroleum industry and therefore proper modeling of deposition is very important.
The major topics covered here are based on Chapter 11 of Pedersen book; 
however, when necessary, the referenced papers are studied and summarized.
